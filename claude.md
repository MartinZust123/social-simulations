Project Overview and Architecture

This document provides a high-level guide for anyone working on the InPerson project. It covers essential coding conventions, user experience guidelines, and patterns that should be followed to keep everything consistent and user-friendly.

Mobile and Desktop Optimization

All changes to the frontend must ensure that the interface remains fully responsive. That means always keeping both mobile and desktop optimization in mind. Whenever you adjust layouts or add new features, double-check that the design works seamlessly on smaller screens as well.

Button Hover States

All buttons should show a clickable mouse cursor on hover. This is a small but important detail to make sure users know that elements are interactive.

Confirmation Pop-Ups

Whenever user confirmation is required—like confirming a delete action—always use a simple, nicely designed pop-up instead of a system message at the top of the page. This makes the user experience clearer and more intuitive.
